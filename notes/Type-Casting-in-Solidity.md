# Type Casting an Address to a Contract Type in Solidity

In Solidity, an `address` is a 20-byte value that represents a location on the blockchain.  
By itself, it doesn't carry information about the contract's interface or functions.

Therefore, to interact with a contract's functions using its address, we need to explicitly **type cast** the address to the contract's type.  
This informs the compiler about the available functions and enables proper ABI encoding for function calls.

## üîß Syntax

```solidity
ContractType(contractAddress).functionName(arguments);
```

---

## üìò Explanation

- **`ContractType`**: The name of the contract whose functions we intend to call.  
- **`contractAddress`**: The address where the contract is deployed.  
- **`functionName`**: The specific function we want to invoke on the contract.  
- **`arguments`**: The parameters required by the function.

---

## üí° Example

```solidity
uint256 subId = VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock(vrfCoordinator).createSubscription();
```

### In this example:
- `vrfCoordinator` is an address pointing to a deployed contract.
- We **type cast** it to `VRFCoordinatorV2_5Mock` to access its functions.
- `createSubscription()` is then called on the type-casted contract instance.
- The returned subscription ID is stored in `subId`.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The contract at `contractAddress` **must** be of type `ContractType` or **inherit** from it.
- Incorrect casting can lead to **runtime errors** if the function doesn't exist at the address.
- This **type casting is purely for the compiler‚Äôs understanding** and doesn't change the actual address or contract bytecode.
